The Essentials of Living Aboard a Boat
Mark Nicholas

Very readable and well written. The text is clearly organized. I think I would recommend it, but only to someone
who is at the very, very beginning of their plan to live aboard a boat. I'm not sure this book would have been helpful to me even after the first few months of watching YouTube videos and reading forums. In other words, it covers the very basics that are repeated often in every book, show and thread about living aboard.
