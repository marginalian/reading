Being Gardner Dozois
Michael Swanwick & Gardner Dozois

Interesting and fast-moving conversation make this a very quick 290 pages, but it wasn't exactly what I expected. They cover all of Dozois's published stories. He goes into great depth on historical and personal context and where the idea originated. There's little on craft and nothing about his work as an editor. Not even a mention of "The Year's Best" anthologies, which came as a disappointment to me.
