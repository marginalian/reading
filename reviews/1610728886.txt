Moitessier: A Sailing Legend
Jean-Michel Barrault

Offers little beyond what you can read in Moitessier's own books, though there are a few passages where the vantage point of being a friend allows Barrault to paint events in Motessier's life from a different perspective. It liberally quotes from Moitessier's writing and jumps over the same periods of his life that Moitessier himself didn't spend much time writing about. I took very few notes, which is usually a sign that I don't enjoy a book, but this one was very readable and there was something great in reading about each part of the man's life in sequence from beginning to end; it really highlighted the values that he held to from childhood and the way he lived them whether he was living in Tahiti, France or San Francisco. Worth the read, but I doubt if I'd reread it.
