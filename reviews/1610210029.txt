Call of the Sea
France and Christian Guillain

The story of the first few years of a couple's life at sea. They go through three boats during that period and travel all around the world during the same period that Moitessier was sailing (he makes several appearances). The book is full of mishaps and adventures, plus some flashbacks to France's early life growing up in Tahiti. By the end of the book, they have three children aboard. 

Overall, worth the read. Thoughtful and occasionally insightful but mostly fun.
